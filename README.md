Integrated Circuit Simulation

This is a simulation for sum of two three-digits binary numbers.

Simulation of a well known integrated circuits to sum numbers in binary language; machine languages in electronics.

Written in Javascript language in html file.
There is one file: 'Integrated Circuit Simulator.html'. To run open it by an internet browser.

Actually as a single threaded language Javascript seems not suitable for multiply processes platforms like electronic circuits. But i thought that i can write this by some programming techniques.

If you have some questions & requests, let me know.
